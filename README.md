# About

This repository contains the code and report for a CS course at Ecole Centrale de Lyon.
It mainly consists in a raytracer code written from scratch in C++.

# Results

The work is incremental. Each step consists in a defined set of features working.
The code for a given step correspond to a git tag.

## Step 1: Geometry detection

## Step 2: Light diffusion

![step 2 render: white ball on balck background](./result/step2.png)

## Step 3: Multiple object handling and color handling

![step 3 render: white ball in a "room" made of red, blue and green balls](./result/step3.png)

"Step" 3.5: refactor code about material and intersection. Add a basic invert gamma function to reduce constrast.
![step 3.5 render: same as 3.5 with less constrast](./result/step3.5.png)
